Sure! Here's a clean and professional `README.md` file for your **LinGear** project, formatted properly for GitHub:

---

```markdown
# LinGear

**LinGear** is a modular, embedded Linux kiosk framework tailored for industrial and edge computing environments. It allows developers and integrators to deploy full-screen GUI applications—using **Qt**, **Tkinter**, or **LVGL**—through a fully automated installer. Everything from system dependencies to autologin and app launch is handled seamlessly.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 **Modular GUI framework support** — choose from **Qt**, **Tkinter**, or **LVGL**
- 🔹 **One-line installer** — automates dependency installation and configuration
- 🔹 **Auto-login setup** — boots directly into your GUI application
- 🔹 **Custom app name & user support** — clean deployments to `/opt/kiosk/<AppName>`
- 🔹 **Extensible architecture** — easy to add new GUI frameworks and apps

## ⚙️ Installation

Run the following on your Ubuntu-based embedded system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LinGear.git
cd LinGear/installer
sudo ./install.sh
````

### 🧠 During Installation You’ll Be Asked For:

* Application **username** – used to create a Linux user for autologin
* Application **password**
* Application **name** – used for folders, services, and labels
* GUI **framework** – choose from Qt, Tkinter, or LVGL
* Application **project** – e.g., `HelloWorld`, if defined in `project/`

---

## 🗂 How It Works

* Stores user config in `/etc/kiosk/`
* Loads required dependencies from `dependencies.txt` or `requirements.txt`
* Copies app from `src/<framework>/` to `/opt/kiosk/<AppName>/`
* Sets up autologin for the new user
* Configures a `systemd` service like `kiosk@<AppName>.service` to launch the app on boot

---

## 🛠 Development Workflow

Want to update your GUI app?

1. Modify your app inside `src/<framework>-app/`
2. Re-run the installer:

   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```
3. Choose the same app name — it will rebuild and redeploy it automatically.

---

## 📌 Example Deployment

* Application directory:
  `/opt/kiosk/MyCoolApp/`

* Systemd autostart service:
  `kiosk@MyCoolApp.service`

---

## ✨ Coming Soon

* 🔸 Flutter frontend support
* 🔸 WebKiosk (WebView + offline caching)
* 🔸 GUI-based installer wizard
* 🔸 Remote device management API
